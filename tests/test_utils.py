    Fixing the random number generator's seed maintains consistency between

    When performing gradient stability tests via PyTorch's gradcheck function
    small perturbations are induced in the input data. However, problems are
    encountered when these perturbations occur in the padding values. These
    values should always be zero, and so the test is not truly representative.
    Furthermore, this can even prevent certain tests from running. Thus, this
    function serves to remove such perturbations in a gradient safe manner.

    Note that this is intended to operate on 3D matrices where. Specifically a
    batch of square matrices.

        m (torch.Tensor):
