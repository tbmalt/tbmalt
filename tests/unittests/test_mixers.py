"""Performs tests on mixers present in the tbmalt.common.maths.mixers module.

For each mixer three tests are expected to be performed:

Test 1) General Operation:
    This should test all of a mixer's general functionality; e.g. it should
    make sure that the `cull`, `reset`, etc. work as intended and that the
    `step_number` and `converged` properties return the expected results.
    This should effectively test everything other than the actual mixing
    operation.

Test 2) Convergence:
    Here the actual ability of a mixer to converge a system should be tested.
    This should be done by passing an instance of the mixer to be tested to
    the `convergence` function. This will ensure that a mixer does converge
    and that it converges to the same result independent of batch_mode and
    zero padded packing. This will not only test that a function can converge
    but also that it can converge to the correct answer.

Test 3) Gradient:
    As the name suggests this will test the gradient stability of the mixer.


Warnings:
    The tests contained within this module have dependencies on other TBMaLT
    modules; `tbmalt.common.maths` and `tbmalt.common.batch`. Without access
    to the `tbmalt.common.maths.eighb` function, no gradchecks can be run on
    the mixers using the `faux_SCC` or `faux_SCF` functions. Due to this, any
    errors in the `eighb` function will cause these test to fail. As such, the
    `test_batch` and `test_maths` unit tests should be run first.

    The general test function ``func`` can be used during debugging to
    decouple the mixer tests from the maths module.
