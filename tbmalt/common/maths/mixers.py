"""A selection of mixing algorithms for aiding and accelerating convergence.

This module contains a selection of different mixing algorithms. These methods
can be used to accelerate and/or stabilise the convergence of fixed-point
iterations. Within the context of TBMaLT, these are intended to help converge
the self-consistent-field/charge (SCF/SCC) cycles.

In the majority of cases it is fundamentally impossible to identify from the
input alone whether the user is attempting to mix a single system or a batch
of such systems. This an ambiguity renders the shape-agnostic & batch-agnostic
programming paradigms incompatible with one another. As such one paradigm must
be abandoned in favor of the other. Thus, all mixing instances require the
user to explicitly state whether they are operating on a single system or on a
batch of systems.

    :math:`f` is the mixing parameter, i.e. the fraction of :math:`x_n` that
    is to be retained. Given a suitable tolerance, and a small enough mixing
    parameter, the `Simple` mixer is guaranteed to converge, however, it also
    tends to be significantly slower than other, more advanced, methods.

    Arguments:
        is_batch: Set to true when mixing a batch of systems, False when not.
        mix_param: Mixing parameter, ∈(0, 1), controls the extent of mixing.

            iterations for a system to be considered "converged".

    Notes:

        The Anderson mixing functions primarily follow the equations set out
        by Eyert [Eyert]_. However, this code borrows heavily from the DFTB+
        implementation [DFTB]_. This deviates from the DFTB+ implementation
        in that it does not compute or use the theta zero values, as they
        cause stability issues in this implementation. For more information on
        Anderson mixing see See "Anderson Acceleration, Mixing and
        Extrapolation" [Anderson]_.

    Warnings:
        Setting ``generations`` too high can lead to a linearly dependent set
        of equations. However, this effect can be mitigated through the use of
        the ``diagonal_offset`` parameter.
