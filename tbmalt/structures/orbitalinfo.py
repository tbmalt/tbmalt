    Arguments:
        atomic_numbers: Atomic numbers of the atoms present in the system.
        shell_dict: A dictionary that yields the angular momenta of each shell
            for a given atomic number e.g. `{1: [0], 2: [0, 0, 0] 6: [0, 1]}`
            designates H as having 1s shell, He as having 3s shells and C as
            having 1s & 1p shell. Values must be lists of integers, not torch
            tensors.
        shell_resolved: If True, calculations will be shell-resolved, if False
            they will be atom-resolved. This is used to automatically
            return the correct resolution information. [DEFAULT=False]

    Attributes:
        n_orbitals (Tensor): orbital count.
        n_shells (Tensor): shell count.
        n_atoms (Tensor): atoms count.
        orbital_matrix_shape (Size): Anticipated orbital matrix shape, e.g.
            Hamiltonian or overlap matrices.
        shell_matrix_shape (Size): Similar to ``orbital_matrix_shape`` but
            with only one matrix-element per shell.
        atomic_matrix_shape (Size): Similar to ``shell_matrix_shape`` but
            with only one matrix-element per atom.
        shell_ls (Tensor): Azimuthal number associated with each shell.
        shell_ns (Tensor): The number of each shell, as defined by the order
            in which they were specified for relevant species.

        >>> geometry = Geometry.from_ase_atoms(molecule('CH4'))
        # Shell dictionary informing the `OrbitalInfo` entity that hydrogen

            For an N-orbital system a NxNx2 matrix will be returned where the
            i'th, j'th vector lists the ℓ values of the i'th & j'th orbitals;
            these being the orbitals associated with the i'th, j'th element of
            the Hamiltonian & overlap matrices.

            The ``sort`` option can be used to enable all interaction of a
            given type to be gathered with a single call, e.g. [0, 1] rather
            than two separate calls [0, 1] & [1, 0].

            For an H4C2Au2 molecule, the full azimuthal matrix with diagonal,
            on-site & lower-triangle masking will take the form:

            .. image:: ../images/Azimuthal_matrix.svg
                :width: 400
                :align: center
                :alt: Azimuthal matrix

            Where all elements in the ss blocks equal [0, 0], sp: [0, 1],
            ps: [1, 0], etc. Note that if ``sort`` is True then the ps
            elements will converted from [1, 0] to [0, 1] during sorting.
            Black & grey indicate areas of the matrix that have been masked
            out by setting their values to -1. A masking value of -1 is
            chosen as it is a invalid azimuthal quantum number, & is thus
            less likely to result in collision. If ``shell`` is True then
            the matrix will be reduced to:

            .. image:: ../images/Azimuthal_matrix_block.svg
                :width: 186
                :align: center
                :alt: Azimuthal matrix (shell form)

            As the diagonal elements are contained within the on-site blocks
            it is not possible to selectively mask & unmask them. Note that
            masking of matrix diagonals are affected only by the ``mask_diag``
            option and **not** the ``mask_on_site`` option.

            A dense matrix implementation is used by this function as the
            sparse matrix code in pytorch, as of version-1.7, is not stable
            or mature enough to support the types of operations that the
            returned tensor is intended to perform.

            Note that an atomic reduction of the azimuthal matrix is not
            possible. Hence there is no "atomic" option like that found in
            ``atomic_number_matrix``.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If an invalid ``form`` option is passed.

        Warnings:
            Azimuthal sorting (``sort``) should be used with care as it will
            introduce inconsistencies with the other matrices. Only use this
