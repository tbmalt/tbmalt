class ScipySkFeed(IntegralFeed):
    r"""Slater-Koster based Scipy integral feed for testing DFTB calculations.

    This feed uses Scipy splines & Slater-Koster transformations to construct
    Hamiltonian and overlap matrices via the traditional DFTB method. It is
    important to note that, due to the use of Scipy splines, this class and
    its methods are not backpropagatable. Thus, this feed should not be used
    for training.

    Arguments:
        on_sites: On-site integrals presented as a dictionary keyed by atomic
            numbers & valued by a tensor specifying all of associated the on-
            site integrals; i.e. one for each orbital.
        off_sites: Off-site integrals; dictionary keyed by tuples of the form
            (z₁, z₂, s₁, s₂), where zᵢ & sᵢ are the atomic & shell numbers of
            the interactions, & valued by Scipy `CubicSpline` entities. Note
            that z₁ must be less than or equal to z₂, see the notes section
            for further information.
        device: Device on which the feed object and its contents resides.
        dtype: dtype used by feed object.

    Notes:
        The splines contained within the ``off_sites`` argument must return
        all relevant bond order integrals; e.g. a s-s interaction should only
        return a single value for the σ interaction whereas a d-d interaction
        should return three values when interpolated (σ,π & δ).

        Furthermore it is critical that no duplicate interactions are present.
        That is to say if there is a (1, 6, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present then
        there must not also be a (6, 1, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present as they
        are the same interaction. To help prevent this the class will raise an
        error is the second atomic number is greater than the first; e.g. the
        key (6, 1, 0, 0) will raise an error but (1, 6, 0, 0) will not.

    Warnings:
        This integral feed is not backpropagatable as Scipy splines are used
        to interpolate the Slater-Koster tables. This is primarily indented to
        be used for testing purposes.

        `CubicSpline` instances should not attempt to extrapolate, but rather
        return NaNs, i.e. 'extrapolate=False'. When interpolating `ScipySkFeed`
        instances will identify and set all NaNs to zero.
