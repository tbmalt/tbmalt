class ScipySkFeed(IntegralFeed):
    r"""Slater-Koster based Scipy integral feed for testing DFTB calculations.

    This feed uses Scipy splines & Slater-Koster transformations to construct
    Hamiltonian and overlap matrices via the traditional DFTB method. It is
    important to note that, due to the use of Scipy splines, this class and
    its methods are not backpropagatable. Thus, this feed should not be used
    for training.

    Arguments:
        on_sites: On-site integrals presented as a dictionary keyed by atomic
            numbers & valued by a tensor specifying all of associated the on-
            site integrals; i.e. one for each orbital.
        off_sites: Off-site integrals; dictionary keyed by tuples of the form
            (z₁, z₂, s₁, s₂), where zᵢ & sᵢ are the atomic & shell numbers of
            the interactions, & valued by Scipy `CubicSpline` entities. Note
            that z₁ must be less than or equal to z₂, see the notes section
            for further information.
        device: Device on which the feed object and its contents resides.
        dtype: dtype used by feed object.

    Notes:
        The splines contained within the ``off_sites`` argument must return
        all relevant bond order integrals; e.g. a s-s interaction should only
        return a single value for the σ interaction whereas a d-d interaction
        should return three values when interpolated (σ,π & δ).

        Furthermore it is critical that no duplicate interactions are present.
        That is to say if there is a (1, 6, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present then
        there must not also be a (6, 1, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present as they
        are the same interaction. To help prevent this the class will raise an
        error if the second atomic number is greater than the first; e.g. the
        key (6, 1, 0, 0) will raise an error but (1, 6, 0, 0) will not.

    Warnings:
        This integral feed is not backpropagatable as Scipy splines are used
        to interpolate the Slater-Koster tables. This is primarily indented to
        be used for testing purposes.

        `CubicSpline` instances should not attempt to extrapolate, but rather
        return NaNs, i.e. 'extrapolate=False'. When interpolating `ScipySkFeed`
        instances will identify and set all NaNs to zero.

class SkFeed(IntegralFeed):
    r"""Slater-Koster based integral feed for DFTB calculations.

    This feed uses polynomial and cubic-spline interpolators in tandem with
    Slater-Koster transformations to construct Hamiltonian and overlap matrices
    in line with the traditional DFTB method.

    Arguments:
        on_sites: A torch `ParameterDict` where keys represent atomic numbers
            as strings, and values are torch parameters specifying the on-site
            energies for each orbital.
        off_sites: A torch `ModuleDict` containing the off-site integrals
            required for constructing Hamiltonian and/or overlap matrices.
            The keys are strings representing tuples in the format
            `"(z₁, z₂, s₁, s₂)"`, where `z₁` & `z₂` are the atomic numbers
            of the interacting atoms (with `z₁ ≤ z₂`), and `s₁` & `s₂` are
            their respective shell numbers. Keys must exactly match the
            string obtained from converting a tuple to a string, including
            the parentheses and spaces; for example, `"(1, 6, 0, 0)"`. The
            values are interpolation modules, such as `CubicSpline`
            instances, that provide the bond order integrals for the
            specified interactions.
        device: Device on which the feed object and its contents resides.
        dtype: dtype used by feed object.

    Notes:
        The splines contained within the ``off_sites`` argument must return
        all relevant bond order integrals; e.g. an s-s interaction should only
        return a single value for the σ interaction whereas a d-d interaction
        should return three values when interpolated (σ, π & δ).

        Furthermore, it is critical that no duplicate interactions are present.
        That is to say if there is a (1, 6, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present then
        there must not also be a (6, 1, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present as they
        are the same interaction. To help prevent this the class will raise an
        error if the second atomic number is greater than the first; e.g. the
        key (6, 1, 0, 0) will raise an error but (1, 6, 0, 0) will not.

    Warnings:
        `CubicSpline` instances should not attempt to extrapolate, but rather
        return NaNs, i.e. 'extrapolate=False'. When interpolating `SkFeed`
        instances will identify and set all NaNs to zero.

class VcrSkFeed(IntegralFeed):
    r"""Variable compression radius based DFTB Slater-Koster integral feed.

    This feed is similar in behaviour to the `SkFeed` but with the ability to
    dynamically change the compression radius in an ad-hoc manner; effectively
    allowing one to smoothly glide from one "standard" parameter set to
    another by adjusting the compression radius.

    This relies upon the existence of a variable compression radius reference
    database. Such as database stores a collection of parameter sets for each
    interaction computed with varying compression radii.

    Arguments:
        on_sites: A torch `ParameterDict` where keys represent atomic numbers
            as strings, and values are torch parameters specifying the on-site
            energies for each orbital.
        off_sites: A torch `ModuleDict` containing the off-site integrals
            required for constructing Hamiltonian and/or overlap matrices.
            The keys are strings representing tuples in the format
            `"(z₁, z₂, s₁, s₂)"`, where `z₁` & `z₂` are the atomic numbers
            of the interacting atoms (with `z₁ ≤ z₂`), and `s₁` & `s₂` are
            their respective shell numbers. Keys must exactly match the
            string obtained from converting a tuple to a string, including
            the parentheses and spaces; for example, `"(1, 6, 0, 0)"`. The
            values are `BicubInterpSpl` instances, that provide the bond
            order integrals for the specified interactions as a function of
            not only distance but compression radius too.
        device: Device on which the feed object and its contents resides.
        dtype: dtype used by feed object.

    Attributes:
        compression_radii: A torch `Parameter` instance specifying the
            compression radius of each atom in the target system. Note that
            this must be manually set for each target system before each call.
        is_local_onsite: `is_local_onsite` allows for constructing chemical
            environment dependent on-site energies.

    Warnings:
        It is critical to note that this class is a work in progress with many
        rough edges. Currently, this feed cannot operate automatically.
        Before this feed is invoked one must set the `compression_radii`
        attribute for the target system. This torch `Parameter` instance should
        store the compression radii for each atom in the target system. This
        will not automatically be set or updated at this time and thus must be
        done manually before every call. Additionally, this feed does not
        support periodic systems. These issues will be addressed later on
        down the line, time permitting.

    Notes:

        The splines contained within the ``off_sites`` argument must return
        all relevant bond order integrals; e.g. an s-s interaction should only
        return a single value for the σ interaction whereas a d-d interaction
        should return three values when interpolated (σ, π & δ).

        Furthermore, it is critical that no duplicate interactions are present.
        That is to say if there is a (1, 6, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present then
        there must not also be a (6, 1, 0, 0) (H[s]-C[s]) key present as they
        are the same interaction. To help prevent this the class will raise an
        error if the second atomic number is greater than the first; e.g. the
        key (6, 1, 0, 0) will raise an error but (1, 6, 0, 0) will not.
